# Command-Line Text Generation Using Gemini API

## Overview
This guide covers how to use the Gemini API to generate text programmatically from the command line. We'll implement this in Rust using Reqwest libraries and API integration.

## Requirements
### Software and Tools:
- **Rust**: Install Rust from [rust-lang.org](https://www.rust-lang.org/).
- **Cargo**: Comes bundled with Rust for managing dependencies.
- **Gemini API Key**: Obtain an API key from the Gemini developer platform. [Click here](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)

### Dependencies:
Add the following dependencies to your `Cargo.toml`:
```toml
[dependencies]
reqwest = { version = "0.11", features = ["json"] }
serde = { version = "1.0", features = ["derive"] }
serde_json = "1.0"
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
